# ⚔️ Trial of the Knight

**Trial of the Knight** is a Python adventure game where you guide a lone knight through perilous trials — dodging traps, battling foes, and proving your worth.  
Built with modular **OOP design**, it separates gameplay logic (`game.py`) from the main event loop (`main.py`), making it easy to expand or modify.

> 🛡️ A project that blends fun gameplay with strong software engineering design.
